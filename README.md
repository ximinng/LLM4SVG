    Our LLM4SVG can understand and generate vector graphics from textual description.
Our LLM4SVG is designed to:
(a) Understand the semantics of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) source code and directly extract the meanings conveyed by vector images;
(b) Generate corresponding structured SVG representations from textual prompts and decode them into SVG source code that accurately reflects the described content.
(c) illustrates some SVG examples generated by our method.
